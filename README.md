# SAVE THE OCEAN 



Save the Ocean is a website created to raise awaresness about ocean waste and the effects it has on the environment. I created this website with my team at Road to Hire as full stack coding apprentices. The website is designed to give users information about the different types of ocean pollutants. As the user scrolls down the page it is directed to a new topic with resources that help the user stay informed. We used a first party API, three 3rd party APIs, and a feedback form that saves the user input into a MySQL database.
